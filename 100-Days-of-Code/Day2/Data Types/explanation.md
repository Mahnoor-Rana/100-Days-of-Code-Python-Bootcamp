# Python Primitive Data Types

## Overview

In Python, there are several primitive (basic) data types that you will frequently use. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming. This document provides an overview of the main primitive data types in Python:

## Data Types

### Strings
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They are used to represent text.
- Example: `"Hello, World!"`

### Integers
Integers are whole numbers without any decimal point. They can be positive or negative.
- Example: `42`, `-7`

### Floats
Floats are numbers with a decimal point. They are used to represent real numbers and can be positive or negative.
- Example: `3.14`, `-0.001`

### Booleans
Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`. They are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program.
- Example: `True`, `False`

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use these data types in Python:

```python
# String
message = "Hello, Python!"
print(message)

# Integer
age = 25
print(age)

# Float
price = 19.99
print(price)

# Boolean
is_student = True
print(is_student)
