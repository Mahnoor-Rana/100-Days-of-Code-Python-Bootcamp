## Tasks for Day 1:

### 1. Install Python
- Go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version.
- Verify the installation by running:
  ```bash
  python --version

## Task 1: Greetings

🎯 **Objective**: Print a greeting message using Python.

Instructions:
1. Write Python code to print greeting
2. Execute your code using the run button.

---

## Task 2: String Manipulation

🎯 **Objective**: Learn string concatenation and the new line escape sequence.

### Part 1: Multiple Lines
Use `\n` to print "Hello world!" three times, each on a new line:

```
Hello world!
Hello world!
Hello world!
```

### Part 2: String Concatenation
Add a space between "Hello" and "Mahnoor" when printing:


Hello Mahnoor

## Task 3: User Input

🎯 **Objective**: Collect and use user input in your code.

Instructions:
1. Use the `input()` function to get user input.
2. Add an exclamation mark to the output.
3. Print a sentence like: "Hello Mahnoor!"
4. Can you figure out how take user input and slot it in between 2 strings?

   
You are looking to print a sentence like this:

Hello Name!

e.g. Hello Mahnoor!

💡 **Tip**: Combine what you've learned about string concatenation and user input.

---

## Task 4: Variables

🎯 **Objective**: Learn to use variables for storing and accessing data.

### Part 1: Check Input Length
Print the number of characters in the user's input using `len()`. Do this in one line of code.

### Part 2: Use Multiple Variables
1. Create a variable called `username` to store the input.
2. Create a variable called `length` to store the length of `username`.
3. Use these variables in your code.

## Task 5: Variable Naming Rules

🎯 **Objective**: Learn best practices for naming variables in Python.

Follow these rules when naming variables:
1. Use descriptive names
2. Avoid spaces (use underscores or camelCase)
3. Don't start with numbers
4. Avoid Python keywords (like `print` or `input`)
5. Keep names simple to prevent typos
6. Follow company style guidelines if applicable

---

## Task 6: Band Name Generator

🎯 **Objective**: Create a program that generates a band name based on user input.

Instructions:
1. Create a greeting for your program.
2. Ask for the user's hometown and store it in a variable.
3. Ask for a pet's name and store it in a variable.
4. Combine the town and pet names to create a band name.
5. Display the result.

💡 **Hints**:
- Use string concatenation to combine variables and strings.
- Use `\n` in your `input()` prompts for better formatting.
