# Tip Calculator Project

## Overview

In this project, we're going to build a tip calculator. The calculator will determine how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

## Example Calculation

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with a 12% tip:

1. Calculate the total amount each person needs to pay:
   \[
   \text{Each person should pay} = \left(\frac{150.00}{5}\right) \times 1.12 = 33.60
   \]

2. The final amount per person, formatted to 2 decimal places, is $33.60.
