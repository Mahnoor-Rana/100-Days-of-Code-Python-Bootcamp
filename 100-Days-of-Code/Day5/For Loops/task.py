# Task: Looping through a list of cars
# TODO: Create a list of car names, including "Honda", "City", "Civic", and "Sportage".
#       Loop through the list and print each car name.
#       Then modify the loop to also print each car name followed by the word "car" (e.g., "Honda car").
#       Finally, print the entire list of cars at the end.
