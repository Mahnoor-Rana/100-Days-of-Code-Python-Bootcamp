# Mathematical Operators in Python

## Overview

In Python, mathematical operators allow you to perform arithmetic operations. Understanding these operators and the order of operations (PEMDAS) is essential for accurate calculations.

## Basic Operators

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division (floating-point result)
- `//` : Integer Division (floors the result)
- `**` : Exponentiation

## Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

PEMDAS stands for:
- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents (or Powers)
- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

This order ensures that operations are performed correctly in complex expressions.
