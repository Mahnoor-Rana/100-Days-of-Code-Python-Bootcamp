# Task 1: Galactic Odyssey Adventure
# TODO: Create a text-based adventure game that uses multiple `if` and `elif` statements to navigate choices and outcomes.
# Instructions:
# 1. Greet the user and present an initial choice to either "land" on a planet or "stay" in orbit.
# 2. If the user chooses to "land":
#    - Ask whether they want to "explore" the surroundings or "set up" a base.
#    - If they choose to "explore":
#      - Ask if they want to "analyze" a discovered alien artifact or "leave" it untouched.
#      - Provide different outcomes based on their choice:
#        - If they choose "analyze", print a message about a groundbreaking discovery.
#        - If they choose "leave", print a message about returning to the spaceship with an uncertain outcome.
#        - Handle any invalid choices with a Game Over message.
#    - If they choose to "set up", print a message about encountering a hostile alien species.
#    - Handle any invalid choices with a Game Over message.
# 3. If the user chooses to "stay":
#    - Print a message about supplies running out and end the game.
# 4. Handle any invalid initial choices with a Game Over message.
